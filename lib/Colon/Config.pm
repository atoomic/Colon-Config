=head1 SYNOPSIS

Colon::Config sample usage

# EXAMPLE: examples/synopsis.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Colon::Config

XS helper to read a configuration file using ':' as separator
(could be customize later)

This right now pretty similar to a double split like this one

    [ map { ( split( m{:\s+}, $_ ) )[ 0, 1 ] } split( m{\n}, $string ) ];

=head1 Basic parsing rules

=over

=item ':' is the default character separator between key and value 

=item spaces or tab characters after ':' are ignored

=item '#' indicates the beginning of a comment line

=item spaces or tab characters before a comment '#' are ignored

=item '\n' is used for detecting 'End Of line'

=back

=head1 Available functions

=head2 read( $content )

Parse the string $content and return an Array Ref with the list of key/values parsed.

Note: return undef when not called with a string

=head2 read_as_hash( $content )

This helper is provided as a convenient feature if want to manipulate the Array Ref
from read as a Hash Ref.

=head1 Benchmark

Here are some benchmarks to check the advantage of the XS helper (name read)
